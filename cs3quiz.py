#Section 1: Terminology
# 1) What is a recursive function?
# A recursive function is a function that calls itself 
#
#
# 2) What happens if there is no base case defined in a recursive function?
# The program would keep calling itself and cause a stack overflow 
#
#
# 3) What is the first thing to consider when designing a recursive function?
# What will go in a base case
#
#
# 4) How do we put data into a function call?
# Indent it then make a variable
#
# 
# 5) How do we get data out of a function call?
# Make it do something then call the function. 
#
#

#Section 2: Reading
# Read the following function definitions and function calls.
# Then determine the values of the variables q1-q20.

#a1 = 
#a2 =
#a3 = 

#b1 = 
#b2 = 
#b3 = 

#c1 = 
#c2 =
#c3 = 

#d1 = 5
#d2 = 7
#d3 = 5

#Section 3: Programming
#Write a script that asks the user to enter a series of numbers.
#When the user types in nothing, it should return the average of all the odd numbers
#that were typed in. 
#In your code for the script, add a comment labeling the base case  on the line BEFORE the base case.
#Also add a comment label BEFORE the recursive case.
#It is NOT NECESSARY to print out a running total with each user input.

		user(averagE)

def user():

	if numbeR == "": 
		print "The average of your numbers was ()".format()
