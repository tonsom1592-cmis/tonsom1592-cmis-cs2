#Part 1: Terminology (15 points)
#1 1pt) What is the symbol "=" used for?
#The symbol "=" is used to assign a value. 
#
#
#2 3pts) Write a technical definition for 'function'
#A function is a sequence of instructions to perform a calculation. 
#
#
#3 1pt) What does the keyword "return" do?
#The keyword "return" is used to return a value 
#
#
#4 5pts) We know 5 basic data types. Write the name for each one and provide two
#   examples of each below
#	1: int 
# int('-23') 
#int(-234+23)
#	2: str
#str('Hello World')
#str('Python')
#	3: float
#float('0.0')
#float('0.1')
#	4: tuple 
#tuple('Tonsom',)
#tuple(18,)
#	5: bool
#print a == 6
#print not a == 7
#5 2pts) What is the difference between a "function definition" and a 
#        "function call"?
# A function definition defines a squence of instructions while a function 
#call, calls the defined squence of instructions 
#
#
#6 3pts) What are the 3 phases that every computer program has? What happens in
#        each of them
#	1: Assigning value to to a function. A value is assigned to a function
#	2:Defining the function. The function is defined
#	3:Calling the function. The function gets called. 
#
#Part 2: Programming (25 points)
#Write a program that asks the user for the areas of 3 circles.
#It should then calculate the diameter of each and the sum of the diameters 
#of the 3 circles.
#Finally, it should produce output like this:
def areaOfCircle(a, b, c):
	return a + b + c

def output(c1
#please dont grade yet, im not done :(

#Circle  Diameter
#c1      ...
#c2      ...
#c3      ...
#TOTALS  ...

# Hint: Radius is the square root of the area divided by pi
